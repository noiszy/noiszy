# Noiszy


Noiszy is a plugin that creates meaningless web data by navigating your browser randomly around a list of sites, to confound tracking & personalization algorithms and burst filter bubbles.

## Open source - here we go

  - By popular demand, we're going open source.
  - This is my first open-source project, so helpful comments will be greatly appreciated.

## A note about tracking
As explained on the [privacy page of noiszy.com](https://noiszy.com/privacy/), we are tracking Noiszy usage with Google Analytics.  This lets me know how many people are using Noiszy, and how much data they're generating.  I completely understand that some people we be bothered that Noiszy tracks anything, but the point of Noiszy is to create data, and to spur the conversation about what should be done with that data.  I believe that knowing amounts of data from Noiszy is useful and reasonable, and it's done transparently - so I stand behind this.  Of course, debate is welcomed.  At any rate, you'll find some GA snippets in the code.
